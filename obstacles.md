## About this file

This file describes difficulties and approaches to solutions in the course of the development of the project.

For more information about the project, please check the readme.md file.

PrÃ´ject delivery date: 03.03.2022, 15:30

## Starting point of the problem

Validation was first created for text fields using functions, with arrays among others.

## Difficulties with validation of non-text fields

The later incorporation of validation of other fields (select, radio) became difficult.

## Solution approach

The order in the process remains unresolved until now (03.03.2022, 15:30). The form is still being developed after the project delivery until a solution is found.

Solution approach as follows:
> Go back to a simple validation process
> Include validation steps for other fields (select, radio)
> Possibly consider again a similar solution approach as at the beginning

## Continue...

The unresolved parts remain in the code as comments. And as described above the project will be developed further after delivery.

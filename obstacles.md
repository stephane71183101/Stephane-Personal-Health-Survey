Setting of the data session and data evaluation with PHP and JavaScript.

## Difficulties with the setting of the data session and data evaluation

The folow-up of the construction (to collect and evaluate date) became difficult.

## Solution approach

The problem remains unresolved until the delivery (22.03.2022, 12:30). I need apparently to improve my ability with PHP and JavaScript so that I can resolve this problem.

Solution approach as follows:
> Resume the theory 
> Try to resolve an easier problem without by myself
